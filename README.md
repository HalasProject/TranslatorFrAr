## What is this ?

TranslatorFrAr it is an Arabic / French word translation software created with **Electronjs** and **Plain js**



## Database ?

Words and their translations are stored in **IndexedDB** is a low-level API that allows the storage on the client side of large amounts of structured data, including files / blobs.

But I used **dexie.js** a rich library and minimalistic Wrapper for indexedDB, you will find all the logic in the module folder



## Text editor

**CKEditor 5** provides every type of WYSIWYG editing solution imaginable,when adding a new word we use the plugin **ckeditor5-build-classic** and for editing **ckeditor5-build-inline**



## Desing UI

Semantic is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.
